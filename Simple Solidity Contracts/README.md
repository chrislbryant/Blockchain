# Solidity Contracts

## These Solidity contracts were created and tested using Solidity, Ganache, MetaMask, and Remix IDE (http://remix.ethereum.org).

<strong>Below are the Ganache testnet addresses used in the contracts:</strong>

* Main Sender - 0xE4aB88C35D85E3C585e84FDf464793072Dd7aCa3

* AssociateProfitSplitter 1 - 0xa5A42738D29Ab7FA2A02a8F47890619fb7D856A0
* AssociateProfitSplitter 2 - 0xDb21D14Cb3A13B846830caf012856655537138Fd
* AssociateProfitSplitter 3 - 0x5c5D876B31d1ddAeeD6caB877bC130DB93B68c6d

* TieredProfitSplitter 1 - 0xC49342131131852559e733B88C1b453d8aac9E13
* TieredProfitSplitter 2 - 0x8c134081c84814A2Fb5136c0745B10526AAFF41c
* TieredProfitSplitter 3 - 0x38126e7887E41C37EaF221E1Ba7F5F32b09C646e

* DeferredEquityPlan - 0x054602554C41b232D8F0DCF6613b8decE17aDA46

## Contracts functions:

Associate Profit Splitter takes ether into contract then divides it evenly to pay employees at associate level quickly.

Tiered ProfitSplitter distributes percentages of ether taken into contract among different level tiered employees.

Deferred Equity Plan models stock plans and manages annual distributions of shares for an employee of the company.

## We do not have real shares for this contract it is merely a model/simulation, but we can see successful contract interactions
